## Dont edit main branch
Please dont push your changes to the main branch without notifying the other contributers.
Main branch is the stable version, even if it doesnt contain anything (kinda a backup).

### Create your own dev branch and push your changes there.
Then create a Pull request for others to review your code and merge it to the main branch
